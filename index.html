         <h2>1. Cars</h2>
         <p>Cars. You see them everywhere you go and most likely see them as just a way to get from point A to point B, but cars are more that just peaces of metal on wheels.</p>
         <ul>
          <li>There're many types like SUVS, sedans, coupes, muscle, pick-ups, supercars, hypercars, megacars, etc.</li>
          <li>The first car was created in January 29th 1886 by Carl Benz. Later on, his automotive business became known as Mercedes-Benz.</li>
          <li>The Car & Automobile Manufacturing industry is worth $100.9 billion. (2022)</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Generally, I mostly prefer supercars and very sporty wagons. Too bad the cool ones cost more than your life savings.. :(</p>

         <h2>2. Video games</h2>
         <p>Unlike cars, video games have the power to entertain any audience - no matter their age, interests, hobbys. Like with cars, there're so many types of games, it would take too long  to list even a small part of the industry.</p>
         <ul>
          <li>In October of 1958, Physicist William Higinbotham created what is thought to be the first video game. It was a very simple tennis game, similar to the classic 1970s video game Pong, and it was quite a hit at a Brookhaven National Laboratory open house.</li>
          <li>The gaming industry is the most profitable industry to date. Data from Newzoo's study points to an annual growth compared to 2021 of more than 5%, exceeding $200 billion in total.</li>
          <li>According to statista.com, shooter and action adventure games were the top two video game genres across the globe in 2021. Shooter games are ranked as the most-played gaming genre for virtually all age groups except for online users aged 55 to 64 years, where it ranked third. Action-adventure were the second-most popular gaming genre, ranking second across all age groups. Online users aged 16 to 24 years were the only age group to have battle royale games in their top gaming genres, whereas older age groups also played MMO or online board games.</li>
         </ul>

         <h2>3. Music</h2>
         <p>Music is generally defined as the art of arranging sound to create some combination of form, harmony, melody, rhythm or otherwise expressive content. Exact definitions of music vary considerably around the world, though it is an aspect of all human societies, a cultural universal. While scholars agree that music is defined by a few specific elements, there is no consensus on their precise definitions.</p>
         <ul>
          <li>The creation of music is commonly divided into musical composition, musical improvisation, and musical performance, though the topic itself extends into academic disciplines, criticism, philosophy, and psychology. Music may be performed or improvised using a vast range of instruments, including the human voice.</li>
          <li>In some musical contexts, a performance or composition may be to some extent improvised. For instance, in Hindustani classical music, the performer plays spontaneously while following a partially defined structure and using characteristic motifs. In modal jazz the performers may take turns leading and responding, while sharing a changing set of notes. In a free jazz context, there may be no structure whatsoever, with each performer acting at their discretion. Music may be deliberately composed to be unperformable, or agglomerated electronically from many performances.</li>
          <li>Music is played in public and private areas, highlighted at events such as festivals, rock concerts, and orchestra performance, and heard incidentally as part of a score or soundtrack to a film, TV show, opera, or video game. Musical playback is the primary function of an MP3 player or CD player and a universal feature of radios and smartphones.</li>
